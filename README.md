# Restful DND
#### Credits
This whole project was inspired by the codepen of Brandon Fulljames

https://codepen.io/evertras/full/YVVeMd/

#### Intro
I thought it would be a great idea to refresh my fullstack 
javascript skills by creating a restful api and leveraging it
with a web application that made it more responsive and allowed
for saving the created sheets somewhere to be accessed and updated

A few other useful features will be incorporated into the application
such as a dice roller and other nerdy dnd  things I would like to code


#### Sprints Progress
It is presently a work in progress but as this gets further
along I will update these sprints

- [x] architecture Store characters in mongo
- [x] repopulate front end char sheet template with stored character
- [ ] add missing form areas to schema (saving throws etc)
- [ ] Code out roll button to auto-generate a character based on class
- [ ] add users database + auth to allow for different users to use 
app and add security
